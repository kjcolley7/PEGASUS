Update @ 2022-11-20 06:25 EST: PEG_AUTOREV2 challenge created with an unintended solution fixed. If you solved PEG_AUTOREV the intended way, then you should be able to solve PEG_AUTOREV2 with only minimal changes to your script.

Now you need to connect this console to the internet to see if it can talk to the old game services! Unfortunately, because it's such an old device, you need to help it figure out how to route its way through the Internet (basically a series of tubes) to reach your ISP. Oh, and also, your ISP uses advanced network security that automatically randomizes the path of connection packets every 30 seconds! Can you get this old console connected through all 5 network hops needed to achieve Internet access before the paths are randomized again? It might be difficult with no pixels to look at...
