While bored during the holidays because the Wi-Fi at your family's house is
infuriatingly slow, you decided to go poking around through the garage. You
come across a dusty cardboard box containing a very unusual computerized device
along with some program cartridges. The first cartridge is labelled "PEGASUS
User Guide". Why not pop it in, power the machine up, and see what happens?
