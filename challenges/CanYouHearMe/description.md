A satellite has fallen from orbit, and miraculously, it is still operational.
It appears to be running on a RAD-EAR-3 CPU, which is known for its reliability
in space applications. The satellite has a handful of program cartridges that
it can swap between (like a jukebox), and one of them is labeled "hello". Can
you figure out how to run it? We need the satellite's serial number!
